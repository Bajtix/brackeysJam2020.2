Hey! You are finally here!
We've been waiting for you for some time now.

Our scientist have found this cave by accident, while searching for a lost dog.
I have no idea how they were looking for a dog in a cave, but anyways here is the outcome.
[break]
Our team started researching this place's... everything. Grains of rocks, grains of sand... Oh and those dead rats too
[shows dead rats]
The sword itself is pretty strange, but it doesn't seem to be dangerous. It just glows, that's all.
If you want you can take a closer look. But better do not touch it. We haven't fully understand where it's energy is coming from.
[Jokingly] Maybe even hell?!
